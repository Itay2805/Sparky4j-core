# Sparky4j-core
The First Java wrapper for The Cherno's Game Enigne!

This uses the original code and some JNI(Java Native Interface) for using the Engine inside Java!

* The engine is a bit slower than the C++ version. This is because of how Java handles JNI.

# How to use
Just download the code, and compile the Java project. Also the java project has a Game class and a Test Layer class for you to try out

* Note that the DLLs are compiled for 32bit. So you might need to download 32bit JDK

# Changes
Some changes have to be made because of Java's diffrence from C/C++


# Currently in progress
* Wrap the Mask class
* Wrap the Renderable2D class (finish)
* Wrap the Sprite class
* Wrap all of the PostFX stuff
* Optimize
